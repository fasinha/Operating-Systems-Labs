=====ASSIGNMENT===========
This lab simulates a two-pass linker that resolves external references and converts addresses from relative to absolute.

(For the full assignment description see file “Lab 01 Description.pdf”)

=====JAVA FILES===========
The following Java files are involved in the lab:
	Linker.java

=====NECESSARY INPUT======
This program, if run with (a) command line argument(s), will treat the first argument as a file name. This value (file name) allows the program to search for a file with the provided name that contains information necessary to simulate a two-pass linker. Examples of such files are stored in the folder “sample_files”.

Should the program be run without any command line arguments, the user will be prompted via standard input.
