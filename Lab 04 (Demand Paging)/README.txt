=====ASSIGNMENT===========
This lab “simulate[s] demand paging and see[s] how the number of page faults depends on page size, program size, replacement algorithm, and job mix (job mix is defined below and includes locality and multiprogramming level).”

(For the full assignment description see file “Lab 04 Description.pdf”)

=====JAVA FILES===========
The following Java files are involved in the lab:
	Frame.java, FrameTable.java, Paging.java, Process.java

=====“RANDOM” NUMBERS=====
Professor Gottlieb’s lab assignments provide students with inputs to check and verify appropriate values. For this reason, random values cannot be truly random or results are unverifiable. The static list of random numbers that the program will come up with is stored in the file “random-numbers.txt”.

=====NECESSARY INPUT======
This program requires certain command line values in order to run. These values allow the program to set values for page size, program size, replacement algorithm, and job mix. Examples of appropriate command line arguments are stored in the file “sample_inputs.txt”.
